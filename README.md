# LambdaSchool-Mini-Bootcamp
HomeworkProject Files from the free 4-week bootcamp by LambdaSchool teaching basic web development with Python. At the end, I will have created a personal website with blog functionalities.

I will be uploading everything that I do here so that i can keep track of my progress! I am a Computer Science student in Southern California trying to learn all that I can in my free time.
